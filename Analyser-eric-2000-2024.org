#+title: Analyser av litteratur i Eric fra 2000 til 2024
#+author: Reidar Mosvold
#+date: Mandag 9. mai 2024

Nedenfor er mine analyser av søk etter fagfellevurderte tidsskriftartikler på engelsk, innenfor Elementary Education, med følgende søkeord i abstractet:
- students
- mathematics

Da jeg avgrenset dette søket til perioden 2000–2024. Dette ga 5683 treff i Eric, og nedenfor følger en analyse av disse. 

* Forarbeide
** Lasting av pakker
Først laster jeg inn de nødvendige pakkene i R. 

#+begin_src R :session :results output
library(revtools)
library(quanteda)
library(topicmodels)
library(ldatuning)
library(quanteda.textplots)
library(quanteda.textstats)
library(stm)
library(tidyverse)
library(wordcloud)
library(ggplot2)
library(seededlda)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** Lasting av tekster
Deretter bruker jeg funksjonen read_bibliography() fra revtools-pakken til å importere Bibtex-filen, og så konstruerer jeg et corpus med sammendragene i Quanteda. Deretter gjør jeg om corpuset til tokens, fjerner symboler og tegn, samt stoppord, og så lager jeg en document-feature matrix. 

#+begin_src R :session :results output
eric3_df <- read_bibliography("~/Github/Emacs/Skriving/Kommentarkapittel-PISA/eric-2000-students-mathematics.bib", return_df = TRUE)
eric3_abstracts <- eric3_df$abstract
eric3_abstracts_corpus <- corpus(eric3_abstracts)
eric3_abstracts_tokens <- tokens(eric3_abstracts_corpus, what = "word")
eric3_tokens <- tokens(eric3_abstracts_tokens, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE, remove_numbers = TRUE)
eric3_tokens <- tokens_select(eric3_tokens, stopwords('english'), selection='remove')
#eric3_tokens <- tokens_wordstem(eric3_tokens)
eric3_dfm <- dfm(eric3_tokens)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Frekvensanalyse
Før jeg gjør en frekvensanalyse fjerner jeg ord som forekommer i alle sammendragene (søkeordene), samt unødvendige ord. 

#+begin_src R :session :results output
eric3_dfm <- dfm_remove(eric3_dfm, c("students", "student", "mathematics", "mathematical", "use", "using", "used", "can", "also", "two", "study", "research", "results", "data", "findings", "one", "design", "analysis", "article"))

features_abstracts <- textstat_frequency(eric3_dfm, n = 25)

* Topic models
Før jeg gjennomfører topic modeling, fjerner jeg ord som lager unødvendig støy. 

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports both
eric3_dfm <- dfm_remove(eric3_dfm, c("student*", "mathematic*", "study", "can", "authors"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Tuning viste 13 topics var fornuftig, så jeg kjører lda-modellen med k=13. 

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports both
tmod_lda <- textmodel_lda(eric3_dfm, k = 13)
as.data.frame(terms(tmod_lda, 10))

32 The number line is a powerful tool for supporting students' understanding of fraction magnitude. Fractions are a critical component of mathematics instruction in the elementary and intermediate grades. More specifically, understanding fraction magnitude is central to mathematical development. Yet, fractions are challenging for many students, particularly students with or at risk of learning disabilities (LD) in mathematics. This article shares: (a) key recommendations when planning and implementing fraction number line instruction, (b) sample fraction number line activities for supporting students' understanding of fraction magnitude and overall mathematics achievement, and (c) strategies for helping students grasp the abstract number line representation.

33 Number lines can benefit students in learning an array of mathematical concepts. An area of mathematics where number lines are visibly underused is in teaching measurement concepts. For students in upper elementary grades, accurate measurements require the use of mathematical precision and coordination, including skills in fractions and decimals, operations, and magnitude. A robust knowledge of measurement holds significant value in students' development of mathematical proficiency, particularly for students with learning disabilities in mathematics. Using number lines to teach and perform mathematical processes involving measurement can build fluency and conceptual understanding for all learners, including those with learning disabilities. This article demonstrates the versatility of integrating number lines into mathematical interventions involving measurement concepts for students with learning disabilities in mathematics. Measurement content discussed includes distance, time intervals, liquid volume, and mass. Scenarios with examples of how to apply number lines to each measurement form are described.

11 This comparative study analyzed the similarities and differences in the mathematical communication used by teachers and primary school students in Japanese, Lao, and Thai mathematics classrooms. It adopted a qualitative research design, and the targets were teachers and students in Grades 1-6 at a selected school in each of the three countries. The data were collected from one classroom at each grade level from the three schools, so eighteen classrooms were involved in the study. The research tools included video recorders, photo cameras, and a field notes form. The data were analyzed by employing the analytical descriptive method based on Pirie's conceptual framework of the means of mathematical communication (1998). The findings revealed that the means of mathematical communication in the three countries were similar in their use of ordinary, mathematical, verbal, and symbolic language--differences in the means of mathematical communication related to how varied the learning materials were. The Japanese classrooms used the most varied means of mathematical communication, demonstrating all six means, while the Thai classrooms used only 5, and the Lao PDR classrooms used only 4. The Japanese classrooms were shown to be focused on the students' diverse self-solution concepts, while some of the Thai and Lao PDR classrooms were based on question-answer interactions between the teachers and students.

25 Interest in teachers' moves to classroom discourse has started to increase since how teachers respond to students' thinking influences students' learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the moves used by one sixth grade mathematics teacher at a public middle school in Turkey to support student reasoning in mathematics instruction and their influence on classroom discourse. Six 80-min lessons were analyzed with particular attention to how the teacher elicits, responds to, facilitates, and extends student reasoning. The results revealed that teacher moves mainly included low-potential moves in all categories. The teacher mainly tried to elicit student answers in the lessons and aimed to facilitate their understanding through questioning. He also tended to confirm students' answers and re-represent their thoughts to the class, occasionally adding further information. However, the results showed that the teacher had a dominant role in classroom interactions. Besides, from time to time, the teacher did not focus on student responses and postpone the student reactions. However, the teacher moves that limit student contribution, such as ignoring students' answers and insisting on their own points of view, reduce the depth of classroom interactions and student understanding. In general, the teacher's ability to support student reasoning and facilitate productive classroom discourse was not sufficient.

42 Although kindergarteners often are excited to share their mathematical ideas, they may not be sure how to explain the underlying reasoning that brought them to their answers. Teachers seeking to use literacy skills in mathematics to support kindergarteners' reasoning can use writing to provide each student an avenue to communicate their individual reasoning. Writing further broadens students' ways of communicating mathematically because this medium incorporates representations, including drawings, which are typical ways young students share their ideas. Developing writing during mathematics class has the potential to provide more insights into students' depth of understanding of the content while advancing key literacy skills. This article shares an approach to introducing and supporting kindergarteners in learning to write mathematically. The article then describes implementation and reflections. Finally, the authors share their plans for continuing this work based on their observations across the implementation.

72 A critical challenge for elementary mathematics teachers is meeting the learning needs of all students, especially when there is variability in students' number knowledge. Because young students' number system knowledge (NSK) contributes to future success in mathematics, NSK activities must be designed to engage all students, particularly students who have struggled to engage in mathematics, to help students build early number knowledge. In this manuscript, we describe a quick images number sense intervention implemented across five second-grade teachers and 75 students, and examine outcomes related to teacher actions and student engagement behaviors. The results of our mixed-methods study indicate that the intervention provided multiple ways for students of varying abilities to engage with and learn the content. Our results provide practical implications for teachers, and prompt questions to evaluate in future research.

88 Fractions remain one of the most difficult topics to convey to students. Thus, employing professional development programs known for improving the teaching and learning process, such as lesson study, is deemed necessary. This study aims to assess and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented research lesson using the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) rubric. This standardized observation tool evaluates the quality of a mathematical instruction. Results indicated that the strengths of the implemented research lesson were demonstrated in the fluent utilization of mathematical language under the domain Richness of Mathematics and the minimal instances of teacher's error and imprecision. On the other hand, weaknesses were observed in student participation under the domains of 'Common Core Aligned Student Practice' and 'Working with Students' in Mathematics. Implications for educators and the various educational processes include among others the importance of lesson preparation, teaching students to articulate ideas explicitly and the continuous use lesson study as a professional learning community.

158 A mixed-methods study investigated the relationship between teachers within urban Title I elementary schools (e.g., high versus low performing) and their mathematics problem-solving beliefs in six constructs ("perseverance," "procedural," "conceptual," "importance," "effort," and "usefulness"). The 181 teachers of students in third to fifth grades in 26 schools (93% response rate) took the 36-item "Indiana Mathematics Belief Scale," and 11 were interviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were conducted. No statistical difference between teachers in high and low-performing schools in their mathematical beliefs was found in any of the six constructs. The qualitative results did deepen the quantitative findings in offering insights into teachers' recognition of the importance of conceptual understanding in mathematics. The implications and directions for future research are discussed, including further inquiry on addressing professional development supports for teaching problem strategies in mathematics.

183 Fractions are an integral part of the mathematics curriculum. Most students acquire proficiency with these concepts during the course of their elementary education and are usually able to perform basic fractions operations when reaching middle-school age. However, a considerable number of students require extra help to not fall further and further behind in the curriculum. In this study, we extended the use of a simple strategy (Look, Ask, Pick; Test & Ellis, 2005) that holds the potential to help students with problems understanding and working with fractions catch up with their classmates. We applied a multiple-baseline design across four struggling sixth graders. After receiving the instruction, all participants' performance on fractions improved significantly; moreover, they viewed the strategy as highly useful. Limitations of the study, future directions of research, and implications for teachers regarding the instructional utility of the intervention are discussed.

186 For students to advance beyond arithmetic, they must learn how to attend to the structure of math notation. This process can be challenging due to students' left-to-right computing tendencies. Brackets are used in mathematics to indicate precedence but can also be used as superfluous cues and perceptual grouping mechanisms in instructional materials to direct students' attention and facilitate accurate and efficient problem solving. This online study examines the impact of operator position and superfluous brackets on students' performance solving arithmetic problems. A total of 528 students completed a baseline assessment of math knowledge, then were randomly assigned to one of six conditions that varied in the placement of higher-order operator and the presence or absence of superfluous brackets: [a] brackets-left (e.g., (5 * 4) + 2 + 3), [b] no brackets-left (e.g., 5 * 4 + 2 + 3), [c] brackets-center (e.g., 2 + (5 * 4) + 3), [d] no brackets-center (e.g., 2 + 5 * 4 + 3), [e] brackets-right (e.g., 2 + 3 + (5 * 4)), and [f] no brackets-right (e.g., 2 + 3 + 5 * 4). Participants simplified expressions in an online learning platform with the goal to "master" the content by answering three questions correctly in a row. Results showed that, on average, students were more accurate in problem solving when the higher-order operator was on the left side and less accurate when it was on the right compared to in the center. There was also a main effect of the presence of brackets on mastery speed. However, interaction effects showed that these main effects were driven by the center position: superfluous brackets only improved accuracy when students solved expressions with brackets with the operator in the center. This study advances research on perceptual learning in math by revealing how operator position and presence of superfluous brackets impact students' performance. Additionally, this research provides implications for instructors who can use perceptual cues to support students during problem solving.

155 Science achievements of individuals play a crucial role when students aim to pursue highly demanded occupations and advanced academic degrees. Enhancing science attainment is crucial in improving the effectiveness of science education. This study investigates the impact of home educational resources, students' attitudes toward learning, instructional practices and strategies, and school factors on science achievement. This investigation utilizes Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2019 eighth-grade science data from the United States. The technique of hierarchal linear models is employed to find the effects of the multilevel factors on science achievements. Results of fixed effects show that science achievement is primarily affected by home educational resources, attitude toward learning, and school composition by student background. Of the four attitudinal predictors, students' confidence in science is most correlated to their achievements. Home educational resources, students like learning science, and self-efficacy for computer use predictors, have significant random effects on science achievement. This study finds that ensuring adequate resources and employing appropriate instructional methodologies to reinforce students' motivation in learning are two major priorities in improving science achievement. The limitations of this research and suggestions for future work are also discussed.

156 A hotly debated topic is the effectiveness of inquiry-based instructional practice in science classrooms on student achievement and motivation. Numerous studies based on multinational large-scale education data show such student-centered instructional practice positively led to students' motivational beliefs but was negatively associated with science achievement. Current literature, however, drew such a conclusion based on the measures of instructional practice from students' perceptions, not teachers, despite teachers being the subject matter experts and actual implementers of classroom activities. Thus, this study examined the relationships between teacher-perceived instructional practice, science motivational beliefs, and science achievement. Specifically, this study investigated the predictive effects of instructional practices on aggregated student motivational beliefs (i.e., self-concept, utility value, and intrinsic value) and science achievement in the classroom context. Moreover, the study explored the contextual effects of student motivational beliefs on science achievement. We examined 3861 eighth graders' data nested within 168 science classrooms in the Korean portion of the latest "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" using multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed that the inquiry-based instructional approach did not predict science achievement or motivational beliefs at the classroom level. On the other hand, student self-concept and utility value positively predicted individual achievement, while classroom-level utility value statistically predicted average classroom achievement. In other words, the significant effect of classroom-level utility value on achievement was beyond the effect of individual utility value. The unique contributions of the study lie in advancing the science education literature with a fresh reflection on such relationships by using a less examined data source (i.e., teacher perceptions), focusing on the classroom context (i.e., classroom-level science motivational beliefs and achievement), and situating in an underrepresented country (i.e., Korea) in the literature. The results shed light on the discrepancies in the effectiveness of instructional practice perceived by teachers versus students on desired educational outcomes in a learning context. This study also discusses the practical and methodological implications for instructional and motivational research.

154 We used the Stanford education data archive (SEDA) data to examine the heterogeneity among urban school districts in the United States. The SEDA 2.1 includes data sets on students' mathematics (Math) and English language arts (ELA) achievement from 2008 to 2014 at the district level. Growth mixture modeling was used to uncover the underlying growth trajectories for urban student achievement from the third to the eighth grade. Two and three growth patterns were observed for ELA and Math achievement, respectively, over time. We used the critical theoretical framework QuantCrit to centralize race in the analysis of the data and shared implications for future research.

205 When the pandemic COVID -19 led to school closures, many of us had no idea that this disruption would last months and perhaps more than a year. Curriculum-based assessment (CBA) is an assessment process that uses academic knowledge picked directly from the material taught in the classroom. This form of criterion-referenced assessment connects evaluation with instructional programs by informing teachers of student progress and learning challenges. In this study a nationwide exam called Transition to Secondary School Exam TEOG Exam was used as a curriculum based tool since TEOG Exam is also second or third exam for semester. The data showed a one and a half year learning loss in both Turkish and mathematics based on Woesmann's (2016) criteria. The difference in the scores for math exam between 2016 and 2020 was 10.32 points which accounts for half of exam standard deviation. Also, the difference in the scores for Turkish exam 2016 and 2020 was 10.91 points which is also around half of the standard deviation. Additionally, based on gender there was a statistically significant decrease of 12.04 points in the mathematics scores of girls and 8.43 points for boys showing a 15-month learning loss for girls. and a year of learning loss for boys. These results showed that girls had more learning losses due to COVID-19 pandemic. According to the mother's education level; the decrease for mathematics scores were between 9.73 (elementary school degree) and 22.02 points (associate degree). This finding shows that the learning loss in math based on mother educational level is between 15-months and 2.5 years. Similar findings showed up for Turkish scores as well. Turkish scores decreased between 10.43 (elementary school degree) and 22.24 points (associate degree). This finding shows that the learning loss in Turkish based on mother educational level is between 15-months and 2.5 years. These results show that some students did not learn new material after the outbreak and even slipped backwards. Ministry of National Education should take important steps to prevent the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and minimize and resolve the learning losses emphasized in this study.

207 In mathematics, the expectation to set up and solve word problems emerges as early as kindergarten; however, many students who experience mathematics difficulty (MD) and dual-language learners often present with specific challenges in this area. To investigate why these populations experience word-problem difficulty, we examined the word, problem solving and oral explanations of third-grade dual-language learners (DLLs; n = 40) and non-DLLs (n = 40), all of whom were identified as experiencing MD. Students solved five additive word problems and provided oral explanations of their work, which were transcribed and coded for the number of words in each explanation, type of mathematics vocabulary terms used, inclusion of correct numbers in explanations, and descriptions of addition or subtraction. We identified no significant differences in word-problem scores between DLLs and non-DLLs with MD. For both DLLs and non-DLLs, students who answered problems correctly used more words in each explanation and used more mathematics vocabulary terms within their explanations. For incorrectly answered problems, the most common mistake for both DLLs and non-DLLs involved using the incorrect operation to solve the problem.

243 Studies of errors in mathematics are essential for mathematics educators to design and contextualize a whole new instruction accordingly. Nonetheless, less attention has been given to the mathematical writing errors when compared to the mathematical conceptual and procedural errors. It is mainly because the former mistakes usually do not affect the final answer or are seemingly irrelevant to students' mathematics knowledge. Most of the studies surveying the mathematical writing errors focus on the undergraduates, followed by middle school students. Little has been done towards the primary school pupils. This paper aims to identify and classify the types of mathematical writing errors committed by primary school pupils in three domains: number and operation, measurement, and statistics. A qualitative approach is employed to identify and classify the mathematical writing errors committed by 29 above-average students from three schools. The results show that six categories of mathematical writing errors are observed. Lack of term or phrase and misuse of mathematical symbols top the overall categories of errors. The close-up views of the solutions with written errors provide some insights to tackle the problem by the mathematics teachers starting from the tender age of the students.

444 One approach to incorporating financial literacy into educational curricula is the integration of it into closely related courses such as mathematics. Research on curriculum development that fosters the integration of mathematics and financial literacy is necessary. This study aims to develop mathematical tasks that are embedded with financial literacy concepts to be integrated into mathematics courses. The tasks were designed for children in Grades 1 through 8. They were shaped by considering mathematical education standards, concepts, subjects and objectives. The tasks also addressed related societal issues including fair wages and working conditions. The dynamics that shape the design of the tasks include the interrelationship between mathematics education and financial literacy, children's (as the target age group) financial understanding and task design parameters. Each task, on the one hand, contains the first page geared toward students; on the other, it presents the implementation steps, teaching guidelines, cautions and limitations for teachers as well as background served as the inspiration for the task design. It is expected that the tasks will contribute to the development of students from an early age in financial literacy education as well as be beneficial for relevant experimental studies.

558 The study of academic achievement continues to be one of the "star" topics in the field of education today because of its great importance as an indicator for assessing educational quality and has therefore been studied from various perspectives. In this regard, the aim of this study was to study which dimensions of self-concept (behavioral, intellectual, physical, lack of anxiety, social or popularity and subjective happiness-life satisfaction) predict performance in each core subjects (Spanish Language and Literature, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and First Foreign Language (English)). For this purpose, a sample of 116 students from the last cycle of Primary Education (10-12 years) was selected by accessibility and administered a multidimensional Self-Concept Scale. The data were analyzed using the multiple linear regression technique, evaluating the Root Mean Squared Error, statistical power and effect size in all of them. The main results show that intellectual self-concept is the most important predictor of academic achievement (p<0.05). Therefore, schools should be aware of the importance of fostering confidence and expectations of success in students' academic tasks.

541 E-STEM (Environmental, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) refers to the integration environmental education into STEM education and can have important role on students' understandings and engineering design process about environmental issues such as plant growth, acid rains, pollution, sustainable agriculture etc. since it engages students in real-world environmental problem-solving that integrates science, technology, engineering, and math. In this manner, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of E-STEM Education on fifth grade students' perceptions and their engineering design process about environmental issues. To reach this aim, a one-group pre- and post-test model was used. The research group of study is five 5th grade students at private school, Istanbul, Turkey. The data was collected with open-ended questions, focus group interview and researchers' observation notes. In data analysis, students' responses to open-ended questions were analyzed with content analysis and classified in terms of adequacy. Transcribed discussions from focus group interview and researchers' observation notes were assessed based on Engineering Design Process Framework. As a result of the study, students' perceptions and engineering design process about environmental issues improved through E-STEM Education.

546 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education is considered critical and valid for the modern workforce which is strongly enveloped in technology. Therefore, it is imperative to reinforce science and math education and knowledge among students early in their educations. Despite this understanding, most research has focused on the importance of mathematics and emphasized its role in science education. Research highlights the relationships between math and science fluency in students' education at a specific point in time (Fleischman et al., 2010). Furthermore, reading has been strongly linked to success in math and also science achievement. However, few studies have examined the relationships among reading, math, and science simultaneously. Given that research identifies reading as a strong predictor for both math and science, it is necessary to explore how ability and achievement in these two subjects is influenced by reading in the early years of school.

618 This study was aimed to develop an instrument to measure primary and secondary school students' attitudes toward mathematics and to find the underlying dimensions that comprise the attitudes toward mathematics. In addition, it was aimed to examine students' attitudes towards mathematics in terms of gender and grade level variables. For this purpose, a five-point Likert-type instrument consisting of 27 items to measure students' attitudes towards mathematics was prepared and applied. The validity and reliability of the instrument were made on the data obtained from 328 students selected by random sampling method among primary and secondary school students. As a result of the factor analysis performed to determine the construct validity of the instrument, it was seen that the factor loads of the scale items ranged from 0.44 to 0.75, the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) value was 0.89, and the internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach alpha) value calculated for the reliability study was [alpha]=0.88. In addition, principal components factor analysis with varimax (orthogonal) rotation applied to find the sub-dimensions of the instrument revealed five factors: (1) in-class; (2) the nature of mathematics; (3) problem solving; (4) understanding and (5) self-efficacy. Findings related to validity and reliability studies show that the instrument has a valid and reliable structure. In addition, as a result of the application of the instrument, it was concluded that the mathematics attitudes of the students did not differ according to gender, but there was a significant difference in terms of grade level.

634 In the current study, the appropriateness of the Mathematics Attitude Questionnaire administered to middle school 8th grade students in the TIMSS 2015 application to the exploratory structural equation and confirmatory factor analysis models was examined. The study was conducted on 6079 students making up the sample of Turkey. In the TIMSS 2015 application, the attitude items are presented under four headings called students' interest in mathematics, students' views on engaging teaching in mathematics lessons, students' self-confidence in mathematics, and students' value mathematics. As a result of the investigation of the factor structure of these items, the attitude questionnaire with its 5 factors and 35 items was accepted to be suitable for the Exploratory Structural Equation Model (ESEM). Moreover, invariance of the TIMSS 8th grade mathematics attitude questionnaire depending on gender was investigated at six stages as configural, weak (metric), strong (scalar), strict, variance-covariance, and latent mean invariance through ESEM. It was concluded that the questionnaire satisfied all the invariance conditions.

616 The comprehension of the place value concept which is based on the grouping of numbers in accordance with distinct systems is not so easy. One of the sources that may contribute to the comprehension of the place value and making connections with daily life is children's books. The effects of several tools on the comprehension of the place value have been analyzed in the literature, but the effects of children's books in this regard have not been so frequent. Therefore, the aim of the study is to analyze the effects of the fifth-grade mathematics lessons integrated with children's books on the students' place value understanding. The study was designed through the case study which is a kind of the qualitative research methods. The participants of the study are 32 fifth grade students. The data of the study were obtained through the place value test, the place value achievement test, and an interview form. The findings indicate that the mathematics lessons integrated with the picture books have positive effects on the fifth-grade students' comprehension and achievement about the place value. Also, the students participated in the study mostly reported positive views about the mathematics lessons integrated with the children's books.

657 In recent years, mathematics classrooms in the U.S. and around the world have seen an increasing integration of educational robotics with interest from both students and teachers. Through their robotics coding activities, students in the present study discovered the concepts of special angle pairs in geometry--namely, complementary and supplementary angles--as they learned to navigate the immediate feedback from the robot Sphero SPRK+ into a trial-and-error mathematics problem-solving process. Students' experiences in these three coding activities revealed, to a certain extent, that engaging in reflective play could be shaped into meaningful teachable moments where students could participate in a "doing with learning" pedagogical method using educational robotics. These activities had transferability implications that might afford STEM learning access and opportunities for students to develop not only mathematical reasoning skills, but also problem solving and critical thinking skills operable to a coding environment. This paper presents students' use of educational robotics in a school geometry curriculum setting to demonstrate the possibility that mathematics concepts could be gathered and mastered in a playful and informal manner, and that robotics games and computer coding could be performed and framed in a thoughtful and challenging manner.

671 The research is relevant as educational computer games are included in students' mathematical activity and form additional opportunities to improve the quality of teaching mathematics in a digital school, to support the formation of the demanded professional competence - computational thinking. To form the appropriate skills that determine the essence of special computational thinking, the authors propose to include game educational spaces based on digital gamification resources into students' mathematical activities. The research aims to resolve the contradiction between requirements of the modern economy for specialists' high level of computational thinking and an insufficiently developed methodological base for training graduates that meets these requirements. The purpose of this research is to study the features of using gamification technologies in teaching mathematics to form the skills and abilities that make up the essence of computational thinking. The article describes directions of educational and cognitive mathematical activity based on the principles of gamification. The authors clarify the concept of "computational thinking", which includes a system of actions for activating patterns, connections between them from human memory, and compile an effective algorithm for solving them: to obtain relevant information on advanced technological developments; to state the problem and model; to use a software product with mathematical content.

5203 This study examined the effectiveness of a supervised mentoring program designed to improve the academic achievement of 834 low-income elementary and secondary school students in Seoul, South Korea. When compared to the control group, both elementary and middle school students exposed to the mentoring program improved in mathematic and reading comprehension, with an effect size 0.29 and 0.33 respectively. Additionally, the duration of the mentoring relationship affected the achievement of participating students. These findings provide support for mentoring programs as a means to reduce resource inequity in low-income school districts and, in so doing, contribute to higher levels of achievement.
